sometimes christofides will only return 
two of the same node because fluerys 
failed and returned [0]

maybe (not sure if this is still an issue) 
there will be a problem where the algorithm 
is ran on the previous data set rather than 
the new one

there is a version of the above bug where 
sometimes the algorithm wil run on the 
previous coordinates and bruteforce on the
new

sometimes (not sure where it originates) a 
optimal solution is calculated to be 
marginally different from the bruteforce 
solution (like 0.00000023km) when it is not
