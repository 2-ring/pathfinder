sometimes christofides will return a solution containing just two of the 
same node because fleury's failed and returned [0] 

very rarely, due to network errors, there will be a problem where the 
algorithm is ran on the previous data set rather than the new one 

sometimes an optimal solution is incorrectly calculated to be marginally 
different from a bruteforce solution (like 0.00000023km), likley a rounding error
