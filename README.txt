Uses the Flask framework.

My first substantial project, completed in sophomore year of high school. It provides a basic framework to compare alternative solutions to the travelling salesman’s problem (TSP). In the backend, the code includes implementations of algorithms including: Christofide's algorithm, a genetic algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, a brute force algorithm, Fleury's algorithm, and MST-DFS. In the front end, the code uses native JavaScript along with Jinja. The program uses APIs including Google Maps and Axios.

An extensive (163pg.) project report can be found in the report directory. There is also an extracted version of the same report, which skips straight to some analysis, without all the formalities. Also, the majority of the technical implementation is contained within the modules/algorithms.py and modules/toolbox.py files—so that could be a good place to start.
